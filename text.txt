twas brilig and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe
all mimsy were the borogroves and mome wraths outgrabe
beware the jabberwock my son the jaws that bite the claws that snatch
beware the jubjub bird and shun the frumious bandersnatch
he took his vorpal sword in hand long time the manxome foe he sought
and rested he by the tumtum tree and stood a while in thought
and as in uffish thought he stood the jabberwock with eyes of flame
came whiffling through the tulgey woods and burbled as it came
one two one two the vorpal blade went snicker snack he left it dead
and with its head went galumphing back. hast thou slain the jabberwock
come to my arms my beamish boy oh frabjous day callooh callay he chortled
in his joy twas brilig and the slythy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe
all mimsy were the borogroves and mome wraths outgrabe
